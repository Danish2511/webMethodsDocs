Example Scenario:

Imagine a retail company that has traditionally used a monolithic application to manage inventory, orders, and customer information. To enhance scalability and maintainability, they decide to transition to a microservices architecture using webMethods.

Inventory Microservice: Manages product stock levels, updates inventory counts, and provides inventory status.

Order Microservice: Handles order processing, including order creation, status updates, and order history.

Customer Microservice: Manages customer profiles, including contact information and purchase history.

Each of these microservices is developed and deployed independently using the webMethods Microservices Runtime. They communicate with each other through APIs, ensuring that the overall system remains modular and scalable.
