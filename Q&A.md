## Basic Kafka Interview Questions

### 1. What is Apache Kafka?
- **Answer**: Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that allows for publishing, subscribing to, storing, and processing streams of records in real-time. It’s designed to handle high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable data pipelines. Kafka is often used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.
- **Explanation**: Think of Kafka as a super-efficient postal service for data. Producers (like apps or systems) send messages (data) to Kafka topics (mailboxes), and consumers (other apps or systems) pick up those messages whenever they’re ready. It’s “distributed” because it runs across multiple servers, ensuring it can handle massive amounts of data without breaking a sweat. The real-time aspect means it’s lightning-fast, making it perfect for things like live analytics or tracking user activity.

### 2. What are the core components of Kafka?
- **Answer**: 
  - **Producer**: Publishes messages to Kafka topics.
  - **Consumer**: Subscribes to topics and processes the published messages.
  - **Broker**: A Kafka server that stores and manages topics.
  - **ZooKeeper**: Manages and coordinates Kafka brokers.
- **Explanation**: These are the building blocks of Kafka. Producers are the senders—they create and push data. Consumers are the receivers—they read and act on that data. Brokers are the middlemen, the servers where all this data lives and gets managed. ZooKeeper is like the coordinator, keeping everything in sync—like making sure all the brokers know who’s in charge and what’s happening in the cluster.

### 3. What is a Kafka Topic?
- **Answer**: A Kafka topic is a category or feed name to which records are published. It acts as a log where messages are stored and organized.
- **Explanation**: Imagine a topic as a labeled folder in a filing cabinet. Producers drop messages into this folder, and consumers can peek inside to read them. For example, a topic called “user-clicks” might store all the click events from a website. It’s how Kafka keeps data organized so everyone knows where to send or find specific types of information.

### 4. What is a Kafka Partition?
- **Answer**: A partition is a subset of a topic’s data, stored as an ordered, immutable sequence of messages. Partitions allow Kafka to scale by distributing data across multiple brokers.
- **Explanation**: Partitions split a topic into smaller chunks. If a topic is a big book, partitions are the chapters. This division lets Kafka spread the workload across different servers (brokers), so it can handle more data and process it faster. Each partition keeps messages in order, but different partitions don’t guarantee order between each other.

#### 5. What is a Kafka Broker?
- **Answer**: A Kafka broker is a server that stores data and serves clients (producers and consumers). A Kafka cluster typically consists of multiple brokers.
- **Explanation**: Brokers are the workhorses of Kafka. They’re the servers that hold all the topics and partitions, handling the storage and delivery of messages. A single broker can do the job, but in a real system, you’d have a cluster of them working together to share the load and keep things running smoothly.

#### 6. What is the role of ZooKeeper in Kafka?
- **Answer**: ZooKeeper manages Kafka brokers by handling tasks like leader election, configuration management, and maintaining cluster metadata.
- **Explanation**: ZooKeeper is like Kafka’s brain—it keeps everything coordinated. It decides which broker is the leader for a partition, tracks the health of the cluster, and stores important info like topic configurations. Without ZooKeeper, Kafka brokers wouldn’t know how to talk to each other or recover from failures.

#### 7. What is a Producer in Kafka?
- **Answer**: A producer is an application or process that publishes messages to Kafka topics.
- **Explanation**: Producers are the data creators. They’re the apps or systems that say, “Hey, I’ve got some info—like a user just clicked a button—and I’m sending it to this topic.” They don’t care who reads it; they just fire it off to Kafka and let the brokers handle the rest.

#### 8. What is a Consumer in Kafka?
- **Answer**: A consumer is an application or process that subscribes to Kafka topics and reads messages from them.
- **Explanation**: Consumers are the data users. They sign up to listen to specific topics and pull messages as they arrive—or whenever they’re ready. For example, a consumer might read “user-clicks” to analyze website behavior. They’re flexible and can start reading from any point in the message stream.

#### 9. What is a Consumer Group?
- **Answer**: A consumer group is a set of consumers that work together to consume messages from a topic, with each consumer handling a subset of the partitions.
- **Explanation**: Think of a consumer group as a team splitting up a big job. If a topic has 10 partitions, and you have 5 consumers in a group, each might handle 2 partitions. This teamwork lets Kafka scale consumption—more consumers mean faster processing. Each message goes to only one consumer in the group, avoiding duplicates.

#### 10. What is an Offset in Kafka?
- **Answer**: An offset is a unique identifier (a sequential number) assigned to each message within a partition, used to track the position of a consumer.
- **Explanation**: Offsets are like page numbers in a book. They tell a consumer, “You’re on message 42 in this partition—keep going from there.” Kafka uses offsets to ensure consumers don’t miss or reread messages unless they want to, giving them control over where they start or resume reading.

#### 11. What do you mean by a Kafka Cluster?
- **Answer**: A Kafka cluster is a group of Kafka brokers working together to provide scalability, fault tolerance, and high availability.
- **Explanation**: A cluster is Kafka’s way of teamwork. Instead of one broker doing everything, you’ve got several sharing the load. If one crashes, the others pick up the slack, keeping the system running. It’s how Kafka handles big data without breaking down.

#### 12. What are the key APIs provided by Kafka?
- **Answer**: 
  - **Producer API**: For publishing messages to topics.
  - **Consumer API**: For subscribing to and reading messages from topics.
  - **Streams API**: For processing streams of data.
  - **Connect API**: For integrating Kafka with external systems.
- **Explanation**: These APIs are Kafka’s toolset. Producers use the Producer API to send data, consumers use the Consumer API to read it. The Streams API is for real-time processing (like filtering or transforming data), and the Connect API hooks Kafka up to databases or other systems. Together, they make Kafka versatile.

#### 13. What are the traditional messaging models Kafka supports?
- **Answer**: Kafka supports both **queuing** (point-to-point, where one consumer processes a message) and **publish-subscribe** (where multiple consumers receive messages).
- **Explanation**: Kafka’s clever—it combines two classic messaging styles. Queuing is like a single delivery to one person; pub-sub is like broadcasting to a crowd. Kafka’s consumer groups give it this dual power, letting you choose how messages get distributed.

#### 14. What are some key features of Kafka?
- **Answer**: High throughput, scalability, fault tolerance, durability, and low latency.
- **Explanation**: Kafka’s a champ at moving tons of data fast (high throughput), growing with your needs (scalability), staying up despite failures (fault tolerance), keeping data safe (durability), and delivering it quickly (low latency). These traits make it a go-to for real-time systems.

#### 15. What is the difference between Kafka and traditional messaging systems like RabbitMQ?
- **Answer**: Kafka is a distributed log system focused on high throughput and scalability, storing messages persistently, while RabbitMQ is a traditional message broker focused on low-latency delivery with less emphasis on persistence.
- **Explanation**: Kafka’s like a giant, permanent logbook—data sticks around, and it’s built for massive scale. RabbitMQ is more like a quick mail carrier—delivers fast, but once the message is gone, it’s gone. Kafka’s persistence and partitioning give it an edge for big data; RabbitMQ shines for simpler, speedy tasks.

### Intermediate Kafka Interview Questions

#### 16. What is the significance of partitions in Kafka?
- **Answer**: Partitions enable parallelism, scalability, and fault tolerance by distributing a topic’s data across multiple brokers.
- **Explanation**: Partitions are Kafka’s secret sauce for handling scale. By splitting a topic into pieces, Kafka can spread them across servers, letting multiple consumers work at once (parallelism). If a broker fails, replicas on other brokers keep things going (fault tolerance). More partitions = more capacity.

#### 17. Explain the concept of Leader and Follower in Kafka.
- **Answer**: In Kafka, each partition has one **leader** (handles all read/write requests) and multiple **followers** (replicate the leader’s data). If the leader fails, a follower takes over.
- **Explanation**: The leader is the boss of a partition—it deals with producers and consumers directly. Followers are backups, copying everything the leader does. If the leader’s server crashes, Kafka picks a follower to step up, ensuring no downtime. It’s how Kafka stays reliable.

#### 18. What is theReplication Factor in Kafka?
- **Answer**: The replication factor is the number of copies of a partition maintained across brokers for fault tolerance (e.g., a factor of 3 means 3 copies).
- **Explanation**: Replication factor is Kafka’s safety net. If it’s set to 3, every partition has 3 copies on different brokers. If one broker dies, you’ve still got 2 copies to keep things running. Higher replication = more reliability, but it uses more storage.

#### 19. What is an ISR (In-Sync Replica) in Kafka?
- **Answer**: ISR is the set of replicas (leader and followers) that are fully synchronized with the leader’s data.
- **Explanation**: ISR is Kafka’s way of tracking who’s keeping up. The leader and any followers that have all the latest messages are “in-sync.” If a follower lags too far behind (say, due to a slow network), it drops out of the ISR until it catches up. It’s critical for ensuring data consistency.

#### 20. How does Kafka ensure fault tolerance?
- **Answer**: Kafka ensures fault tolerance through replication (multiple copies of partitions) and leader election (a follower becomes the leader if the current leader fails).
- **Explanation**: Fault tolerance is about surviving hiccups. Replication means data’s duplicated across brokers, so losing one isn’t a disaster. Leader election means if the main server for a partition goes down, a backup steps in fast. Together, they keep Kafka humming along.

#### 21. What is the purpose of the Kafka Offset?
- **Answer**: Offsets track the position of a consumer in a partition, ensuring messages are processed in order and not missed or duplicated.
- **Explanation**: Offsets are bookmarks. They let a consumer say, “I’ve read up to message 100—next time, start at 101.” This keeps things orderly and lets consumers restart or rewind without losing their place.

#### 22. How does Kafka handle message ordering?
- **Answer**: Kafka guarantees message ordering within a partition, but not across multiple partitions.
- **Explanation**: Inside one partition, messages stay in the order they were sent—first in, first out. But if a topic has multiple partitions, there’s no promise about the order across them. Want strict order? Use one partition or add a key to keep related messages together.

#### 23. What is the difference between a Kafka Topic and a Partition?
- **Answer**: A topic is a logical category for messages, while a partition is a physical subset of a topic’s data stored on a broker.
- **Explanation**: A topic is the big idea—like “website-logs.” Partitions are the pieces that make it up, spread across servers. One topic might have 5 partitions, each holding part of the data. Topics are abstract; partitions are where the rubber meets the road.

#### 24. What is the default retention period in Kafka?
- **Answer**: The default retention period is 7 days (`log.retention.hours=168`).
- **Explanation**: Kafka keeps messages around for a week by default before tossing them out. This gives consumers time to catch up or reprocess data. You can tweak this setting—shorter for less storage, longer if you need more history.

#### 25. How does Kafka achieve high throughput?
- **Answer**: Kafka achieves high throughput through partitioning, batching, and sequential disk I/O.
- **Explanation**: High throughput means moving lots of data fast. Partitions split the work across brokers, batching groups messages to send fewer, bigger chunks, and sequential I/O writes to disk efficiently (like writing a book page-by-page instead of jumping around). It’s Kafka’s recipe for speed.

#### 26. What is the role of the Kafka Controller?
- **Answer**: The controller is a broker responsible for managing partition leaders and handling cluster-wide operations like leader election.
- **Explanation**: The controller is the cluster’s manager. It watches ZooKeeper to see when brokers fail or join, then assigns new leaders for partitions as needed. It’s the glue that keeps the cluster coordinated.

#### 27. What is a Kafka Message?
- **Answer**: A Kafka message is a key-value pair with optional headers, where the key determines the partition and the value is the payload.
- **Explanation**: Messages are the data packets Kafka moves around. The key (optional) decides which partition it goes to—like a sorting label. The value is the actual info, like “user X clicked Y.” Headers add extra metadata if needed.

#### 28. What are Kafka Logs?
- **Answer**: Kafka logs are the append-only, immutable sequences of messages stored in partitions on disk.
- **Explanation**: Logs are Kafka’s memory. Each partition has a log file where messages get added to the end, never changed or deleted until the retention period’s up. It’s simple, fast, and keeps everything in order.

#### 29. How does Kafka handle message delivery semantics?
- **Answer**: Kafka supports:
  - **At-most-once**: Message delivered once or not at all.
  - **At-least-once**: Message delivered one or more times.
  - **Exactly-once**: Message delivered exactly once (using transactions or idempotency).
- **Explanation**: These are promises about delivery. “At-most-once” risks losing messages but avoids duplicates. “At-least-once” ensures delivery but might repeat. “Exactly-once” is the gold standard—no loss, no doubles—using tricks like unique IDs or transactions. You pick based on your needs.

#### 30. What is the Kafka Connect API used for?
- **Answer**: The Connect API integrates Kafka with external systems (e.g., databases, file systems) by providing reusable connectors for data import/export.
- **Explanation**: Connect API is Kafka’s bridge to the outside world. It’s got pre-built connectors—like one for sucking data from a database into Kafka, or pushing Kafka data to a file. It saves you from writing custom code for common integrations.

### Advanced Kafka Interview Questions

#### 31. What is the Streams API in Kafka?
- **Answer**: The Streams API is a library for processing and transforming data streams in Kafka in real-time, treating data as an unbounded sequence.
- **Explanation**: Streams API turns Kafka into a data processor, not just a mover. It lets you write code to filter, join, or aggregate messages as they flow through topics—like calculating running totals of user clicks live. It’s for real-time magic.

#### 32. What is the difference between Kafka Streams and Kafka Consumer?
- **Answer**: Kafka Streams processes data streams in real-time with a higher-level abstraction, while the Consumer API is for reading messages with manual processing logic.
- **Explanation**: Consumer API is raw—you read messages and decide what to do. Streams API is fancier—it’s built for stream processing with tools to transform data on the fly. Think of Consumer as a shovel, Streams as a bulldozer.

#### 33. What is Kafka MirrorMaker?
- **Answer**: MirrorMaker is a tool for replicating data between Kafka clusters, often used for disaster recovery or cross-data-center synchronization.
- **Explanation**: MirrorMaker is Kafka’s copier. It takes data from one cluster and mirrors it to another—like keeping a backup in a different city. Handy for keeping systems in sync or recovering if one cluster goes down.

#### 34. How does Kafka ensure exactly-once delivery?
- **Answer**: Kafka ensures exactly-once delivery using idempotent producers (unique message IDs) and transactions (atomic writes across topics).
- **Explanation**: Exactly-once is tricky—Kafka nails it with two tricks. Idempotent producers tag each message with a unique ID, so duplicates get ignored. Transactions bundle writes, so either all succeed or none do. It’s like a perfect handshake between producer and broker.

#### 35. What is the purpose of the Kafka Schema Registry?
- **Answer**: The Schema Registry manages and enforces schemas for Kafka messages (e.g., Avro, JSON), ensuring compatibility and data consistency.
- **Explanation**: Schema Registry is Kafka’s rulebook for data. It stores schemas (like blueprints for message structure) so producers and consumers agree on what data looks like. If a producer changes a field, the registry checks it won’t break consumers—keeps everything tidy.

#### 36. How does Kafka handle backpressure?
- **Answer**: Kafka handles backpressure implicitly—producers slow down if brokers are overloaded, and consumers pull data at their own pace.
- **Explanation**: Backpressure is when data comes too fast. Kafka’s pull model means consumers only grab what they can handle, and producers get throttled if brokers can’t keep up. It’s a natural balance—no explicit “slow down” button needed.

#### 37. What is the difference between log compaction and retention in Kafka?
- **Answer**: Retention deletes old messages after a time or size limit; log compaction keeps the latest message per key indefinitely.
- **Explanation**: Retention is a timer—messages expire after, say, 7 days. Log compaction is smarter—it keeps only the newest version of each key’s message forever. Retention clears space; compaction preserves a current snapshot.

#### 38. What are the advantages of using Kafka over Flume?
- **Answer**: Kafka offers higher throughput, scalability, and fault tolerance with persistent storage, while Flume is simpler but less flexible, designed for log collection.
- **Explanation**: Kafka’s a powerhouse—built for massive, reliable data streams with storage baked in. Flume’s lighter, great for funneling logs to Hadoop, but it’s not as robust or scalable. Kafka wins for big, complex systems.

#### 39. How does Kafka integrate with Hadoop?
- **Answer**: Kafka integrates with Hadoop via connectors (e.g., Kafka Connect) or by streaming data to HDFS for batch processing.
- **Explanation**: Kafka and Hadoop are buddies. Kafka Connect can pipe real-time data into Hadoop’s HDFS for later analysis. It’s like Kafka handing off live streams to Hadoop’s big storage and crunching power.

#### 40. What is a Dead Letter Queue in Kafka?
- **Answer**: A Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) is a topic where failed or unprocessable messages are sent for later analysis or retry.
- **Explanation**: DLQ is Kafka’s “oops” bin. If a consumer can’t handle a message (say, it’s malformed), it shoves it into a DLQ topic. You can then figure out what went wrong or retry it later—keeps the main flow moving.

#### 41. How do you monitor a Kafka cluster?
- **Answer**: Use tools like Kafka Manager, Prometheus with JMX exporter, or Confluent Control Center to track metrics (e.g., lag, throughput, broker health).
- **Explanation**: Monitoring is keeping an eye on Kafka’s pulse. Tools grab stats—like how fast messages move or if consumers are lagging—and display them. Prometheus with JMX is popular for detailed, real-time insights.

#### 42. What is the significance of the `acks` configuration in Kafka Producer?
- **Answer**: `acks` defines how many broker acknowledgments a producer waits for:
  - `0`: No acknowledgment (fast, risky).
  - `1`: Leader acknowledgment (balanced).
  - `all`: All in-sync replicas (safest, slowest).
- **Explanation**: `acks` is about trust. Set it to 0, and the producer fires and forgets—speedy but risky. 1 waits for the leader to say “got it”—a middle ground. “All” waits for every replica, ensuring no data loss but slowing things down. Pick your tradeoff.

#### 43. How does Kafka handle large messages?
- **Answer**: Kafka handles large messages by splitting them into smaller chunks (via producer settings like `max.request.size`) or compressing them.
- **Explanation**: Big messages don’t scare Kafka—it breaks them into bite-sized pieces or zips them up to fit. You tweak settings to allow bigger payloads, but compression’s often the real hero—keeps things efficient.

#### 44. What is the role of the Consumer Rebalance in Kafka?
- **Answer**: Consumer rebalance redistributes partitions among consumers in a group when consumers join, leave, or fail.
- **Explanation**: Rebalancing is Kafka’s reshuffle. If a consumer crashes or a new one joins, Kafka reassigns partitions so everyone still has work to do. It’s automatic but can pause processing briefly—keeps the group fair and balanced.

#### 45. What are the common causes of consumer lag in Kafka?
- **Answer**: Slow consumer processing, high message volume, insufficient partitions, or network issues.
- **Explanation**: Lag is when consumers fall behind. Maybe they’re too slow crunching data, or there’s a flood of messages. Too few partitions bottleneck parallelism, and bad networks delay fetches. Fix it by speeding up consumers or adding partitions.

#### 46. How does Kafka support multi-tenancy?
- **Answer**: Kafka supports multi-tenancy via topic namespaces, access control lists (ACLs), and quotas to isolate tenants.
- **Explanation**: Multi-tenancy is sharing Kafka nicely. Each tenant gets their own topics (like “tenantA-logs”), ACLs lock down who sees what, and quotas cap usage so no one hogs the cluster. It’s like renting apartments in a building—everyone’s separate but cozy.

#### 47. What are Kafka Transactions?
- **Answer**: Transactions ensure atomic writes across multiple topics/partitions, enabling exactly-once semantics.
- **Explanation**: Transactions are Kafka’s “all or nothing” deal. A producer can write to several topics in one go, and either every write succeeds, or none do. It’s key for exactly-once delivery—perfect for critical stuff like payments.

#### 48. How do you tune Kafka for better performance?
- **Answer**: Increase partitions, adjust batch sizes, enable compression, tweak buffer memory, and optimize consumer fetch settings.
- **Explanation**: Tuning Kafka is like souping up a car. More partitions spread the load, bigger batches reduce trips, compression shrinks data, and buffer tweaks smooth out hiccups. Test and tweak based on your workload.

#### 49. What is the difference between Kafka and Spark Streaming?
- **Answer**: Kafka is a messaging system for streaming data; Spark Streaming is a processing framework that consumes Kafka data for analytics.
- **Explanation**: Kafka’s the pipeline—moves data around. Spark Streaming’s the factory—takes that data and crunches it (e.g., aggregations, ML). Kafka feeds Spark; they’re a dynamic duo, not rivals.

#### 50. How does Kafka handle security?
- **Answer**: Kafka uses SSL/TLS for encryption, SASL for authentication, and ACLs for authorization.
- **Explanation**: Kafka locks things down tight. SSL/TLS scrambles data in transit, SASL checks who’s knocking (like a password), and ACLs say who can touch which topics. It’s a three-layer shield against snoops and troublemakers.

#### 51. What is the purpose of the `min.insync.replicas` configuration?
- **Answer**: `min.insync.replicas` specifies the minimum number of in-sync replicas required for a producer write to succeed when `acks=all`.
- **Explanation**: This setting’s a safety check. If it’s 2, and `acks=all`, the leader won’t confirm a write unless at least 2 replicas (including itself) have it. Fewer than that? Write fails—keeps data safe but can slow you down.

#### 52. What are Kafka Connectors?
- **Answer**: Connectors are pre-built integrations (via Kafka Connect) for moving data between Kafka and external systems like databases or S3.
- **Explanation**: Connectors are plug-and-play helpers. Need data from MySQL to Kafka? There’s a connector for that. Want Kafka data in S3? Another connector. They’re shortcuts to avoid custom coding.

#### 53. How does Kafka handle schema evolution?
- **Answer**: Kafka uses Schema Registry to manage schema versions, ensuring backward/forward compatibility for evolving data formats.
- **Explanation**: Schema evolution is about change without chaos. Schema Registry tracks versions—like adding a field to a message—and checks compatibility. Consumers can handle old or new formats smoothly, no crashes.

#### 54. What is the impact of increasing the number of partitions in Kafka?
- **Answer**: More partitions increase parallelism and throughput but add overhead (more files, memory, rebalancing).
- **Explanation**: Extra partitions boost speed—more consumers can work at once—but it’s not free. Brokers juggle more files, use more memory, and rebalancing takes longer when consumers shift. Balance is key.

#### 55. How does Kafka ensure data durability?
- **Answer**: Kafka ensures durability through replication and writing messages to disk before acknowledging them.
- **Explanation**: Durability means data sticks around. Replication makes copies across brokers, so losing one isn’t fatal. Writing to disk (not just memory) before saying “done” ensures crashes don’t erase it. Solid as a rock.

#### 56. What is the difference between Kafka and RabbitMQ?
- **Answer**: Kafka is a distributed log for high-throughput streaming with persistence; RabbitMQ is a traditional message broker for low-latency queuing without persistence.
- **Explanation**: Kafka’s a data highway—stores everything, scales big. RabbitMQ’s a quick courier—delivers fast, forgets after. Kafka’s for streaming giants; RabbitMQ’s for simpler messaging.

#### 57. What is the significance of the `max.poll.records` configuration?
- **Answer**: `max.poll.records` limits the number of records a consumer fetches in one poll, controlling throughput and memory usage.
- **Explanation**: This setting caps how much a consumer grabs at once. Set it high for speed, low to avoid overwhelming memory. It’s a dial for balancing performance and stability.

#### 58. How does Kafka handle network partitions?
- **Answer**: Kafka relies on ZooKeeper and replication; if a broker is isolated, its partitions’ leadership shifts to in-sync replicas on reachable brokers.
- **Explanation**: Network partitions split the cluster—Kafka adapts. ZooKeeper spots the issue, and leadership moves to replicas still online. Data stays available, though isolated brokers wait to reconnect.

#### 59. What are the best practices for Kafka topic design?
- **Answer**: Use meaningful names, set appropriate partition counts, configure retention/compaction, and plan for keys.
- **Explanation**: Good topic design is practical. Names like “orders-prod” make sense, partitions match load, retention fits use (days or forever via compaction), and keys group related data. Keeps things clean and efficient.

#### 60. How do you upgrade a Kafka cluster without downtime?
- **Answer**: Perform a rolling upgrade—update one broker at a time, ensuring compatibility and monitoring health.
- **Explanation**: Rolling upgrades are smooth. Shut down one broker, update it, restart, move to the next—cluster stays up. Check versions match and watch metrics to avoid surprises. No one notices a thing.

#### 61. What is the purpose of the `group.id` in Kafka consumers?
- **Answer**: `group.id` identifies a consumer group, enabling partition assignment and offset tracking for that group.
- **Explanation**: `group.id` is the team tag. All consumers with the same ID share partitions and track progress together. Change it, and you’re in a new group with a fresh start—key for coordination.

#### 62. How does Kafka handle consumer failures?
- **Answer**: Kafka rebalances partitions to surviving consumers in the group and resumes from the last committed offset.
- **Explanation**: Consumer dies? Kafka shrugs. The group reassigns its partitions to the rest, and they pick up where it left off (thanks to offsets). Keeps the show running without fuss.

#### 63. What is the difference between `delete` and `compact` retention policies?
- **Answer**: `delete` removes messages after a time/size limit; `compact` keeps the latest message per key indefinitely.
- **Explanation**: `delete` is a clean sweep—old stuff’s gone. `compact` is selective—keeps the newest version of each key’s message, like a living archive. Depends on whether you want history or just the latest.

#### 64. How does Kafka support GDPR compliance?
- **Answer**: Kafka supports GDPR with data retention policies, log compaction for deletion, and ACLs for access control.
- **Explanation**: GDPR demands data control. Kafka’s retention limits storage time, compaction can “forget” old records by key, and ACLs restrict who sees what. It’s not automatic—you configure it to comply.

#### 65. What are the common failure scenarios in Kafka?
- **Answer**: Broker failure, network partitions, consumer lag, producer overload, ZooKeeper downtime.
- **Explanation**: Stuff happens—brokers crash (replication saves you), networks split (leadership shifts), consumers lag (slow processing), producers flood (backpressure kicks in), or ZooKeeper naps (cluster stalls). Kafka’s built to handle most, but you watch for snags.

#### 66. How does Kafka handle high availability?
- **Answer**: Kafka ensures high availability with replication, leader election, and multiple brokers in a cluster.
- **Explanation**: High availability is uptime. Replication keeps data copies, leader election swaps in backups fast, and multiple brokers mean no single point of failure. Cluster stays alive through chaos.

#### 67. What is the purpose of the `linger.ms` configuration in Kafka Producer?
- **Answer**: `linger.ms` sets how long a producer batches messages before sending, balancing latency and throughput.
- **Explanation**: `linger.ms` is a pause button. Set it to 5ms, and the producer waits that long to pack more messages into a batch—fewer sends, higher throughput, but a tiny delay. Tweak it for your speed vs. latency needs.

#### 68. How does Kafka ensure load balancing?
- **Answer**: Kafka balances load by distributing partitions across brokers and reassigning them during consumer rebalancing.
- **Explanation**: Load balancing is fair play. Partitions spread out so no broker’s swamped, and when consumers shift, Kafka reshuffles partitions to keep everyone busy. It’s automatic and dynamic.

#### 69. What are the tools available for Kafka administration?
- **Answer**: Kafka Manager, Confluent Control Center, kcat, and Kafka command-line tools (e.g., `kafka-topics.sh`).
- **Explanation**: Admin tools are your Kafka toolkit. Kafka Manager and Confluent Control Center give GUIs for oversight, kcat’s a Swiss Army knife for CLI fans, and Kafka’s built-in scripts handle basics like topic creation. Pick what fits.

#### 70. How do you debug a Kafka producer issue?
- **Answer**: Check logs, verify configurations (`acks`, `retries`), monitor metrics (e.g., latency, errors), and test connectivity to brokers.
- **Explanation**: Debugging a producer’s like detective work. Logs reveal errors, configs show if it’s waiting too long or retrying enough, metrics flag delays, and a ping to brokers confirms they’re alive. Start there, narrow it down.
